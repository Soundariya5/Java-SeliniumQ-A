1. What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
     -Selenium is a free automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms
     -We can use multiple programming laungages like Java,C#,Python etc to create Selenium test scripts.
     Components:Selenium Grid,Selenium RC,Selenium Web Driver,Selenium IDE.
     Selenium Webdriver:It is a successor to selenium RC.Selenium webdriver accepts commands and sends them to a browser. It does not need a special server to execute tests.

2. How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
     -Selenium WebDriver is a browser automation framework that accepts commands and sends them to a browser. It is implemented through a browser-specific driver. It controls the browser by directly communicating with it.

3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
    -By ID
    -By name
    -By classname
    -By tag name
    -By linkText
    -By partial link text
    -By CSS
    -By Xpath 

4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
   ID are unique on any HTML page.
   Whereas, Xpath browser iterates through entire DOM structure to find element.Which is pretty ineffient.
    
5.How to select value in dropdown?
   WebElement dd1=driver.findElement(By.id("dropdown1"));
   Select dropdown1=new Select(dd1);
   dropdown1.selectByVisibleText("Appium");
      
6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
   Absolute path:It specifies the location from the root directory.
   Relative path:It is related to the current directory.
   
7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html
     We can used the isSelected() method over the checkbox element. 
     The isSelected() method returns a boolean value of true if the checkbox is checked false otherwise
  
8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
     -WebDriverManager-- is an API that allows users to automate the handling of driver executables like chromedriver.exe
      WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
      It checks the version of the browser and driver.
     -System.setProperty  method to used to set its path.
      System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/absolute/path/to/binary/chromedriver");
9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
     Elder cousin xpath//following::Younger cousin tagname[index]
     Younger cousing xpath//preceding::tagname

10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
     WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
     ChromeDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
     driver.get("https://www.facebook.com/");
