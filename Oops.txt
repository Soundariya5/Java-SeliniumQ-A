1.What is oops stands for?
    -Oops Stands for object oriented programming language/Structure.

2.What is Polymorphism? explain types?
    -Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
    - Polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations

3.what is interface and example in selenium,java?
    -Interface is a design,Statement end with semicolon(;).
    -Static constant and abstract methods. 100% unimplemented methods
     -Ex:Java-List,Set,collection
         Selenium-WedDriver,webelement,TakeSnapShot

4.what is abstarct class and example?
     -Abstract class is a partially implemented +unimplemented methods.
     -We can create a object because of unimplemented methods.
      Ex:java:AbstractList,AbstractCollections
         Selenium:By     

5.Difference between multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
     -Multiple-(does not possible for class,java as class level) if it create mulitple class then it execute ambiguity problem
     -Multilevel-grand parent-->parent-->subclass---chromedriver extends chromiumdriver extends Remotedriver(webdriver-printpages,takescreenshot)

6.Is multiple inheritance possible in java?
     -It is not possible in java because java as class level, When it create multiple class then it execute ambiguity problem.

7.What is keyword for using inheritance 
     -Extend keyword used in inheritance concept
 
8.what is the keyword to connect interface and class
     -Implements key word used to connect iterface and class

9.what is difference between class and interface
     -Class is a blueprint or template used to create object with common variables and methods.In class we create object.
     -Interface is a design, we can't create object in interface

10.what is difference between class and abstract class
     -partially implemented-implement+unimplement is abstract class,class also abstract class
     -we cant create the object because of unimplemented methods
